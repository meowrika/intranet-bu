<strong>THANK YOU, Dominique and Team!</strong>
Big thanks to (in order of appearance) Sheida, Peter, Heather, Tristan, Dominique, Cathy, Jeff, Scott, and Kari for their excellent work briefing our newest Leadership Council member Dennis McLerran! Thanks also to the admin team for helping set up and clean up! And huge thanks, as always, to Dominique for organizing everything, producing a robust binder of materials for Dennis, and making sure we had light refreshments for him. Dennis remarked that the orientation was very well organized and informative. Go team!

<strong>THANK YOU, ALL PSPers!</strong>
I've been here a little over a year now and want to thank you for making the year interesting, memorable and rewarding. I have learned so much and stand in awe of your dedication and expertise. I am happy to be working here with you, in this lovely setting, and for a very worthwhile mission. Thanks again, and have a super summer.

<strong>Thank you, every single one of you!</strong>
It's been 1 month already! I want to send a BIG thank you to Dominique, Debbie and Charisse for helping me figure everything out and always being available to answer questions or offer support! I'm really enjoying being a part of the admin team! I also want to thank Kelly, who is so busy, but will stop what she's doing to help me. I see you do that all the time for everyone and I think you are awesome! And...thanks to everyone here for making me feel very welcome and taking the time to teach me or explain things to me. I am really proud to be a part of the PSP!

<strong>Thank you, <a href="http://intranet2.psp.wa.gov/staff/dominiquehampton/">Dominique</a>!</strong>
I thank Dominique for stepping up to supervise the misfit Admins. A group without a place to call their own and she said absolutely I'll do it. She works very hard supporting the Boards plus now she is the supervisor of the year as far as I can see. She is there to listen and support in any way she can. Kudos for being there.
